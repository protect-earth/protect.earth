# Contributing Guidelines

This is a GatsbyJS site, on top of Netlify CMS for now, and powered by YAML files.

Swing by `src/data/links/` to see all the links, and if you'd like to add a new one just copy and paste one of the older ones and update it.

[Spectral](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral) will help you make sure the YAML is right, either run it on the CLI, via the VS Code extension, or let the GitHub Action let you know how it did.
