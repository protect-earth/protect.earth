All around the world people handle things like using toilets, cleaning themselves, and baby diapers really differently. Western countries do everything in the least inefficient, least hygienic, and most expensive way. It all comes with a giant carbon footprint too. Let's look at some environmentally friendly alternatives which are just as good as what you're probably already doing, possibly cheaper, and possibly even _more_ hygienic.

For example, diapers are a mess. The average [baby uses 4,000 to 6,000 disposable nappies](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45732371), or 20 to 30 reusable nappies. Reusable nappies can be passed down from baby to baby, reducing the footprint of their manufacturing each time. If cleaned with [renewable energy](/renewable-energy/) you're golden. Compare this to 3,750,000 tonnes of diapers going into landfill every year. That's 10 Empire State Buildings of shitty diapers going into the ground every year...
