  Electric cars are still priced beyond the reach of many, but swapping a car
  for an electric motorbike will leave plenty of cash in your pocket. The
  average used car sells for $20,840 in the USA, and you can get a lot of
  electric motorbike for $3,000. Finding a used electric motorbike will get that
  manufactoring footprint off your conscience too.
