description: 'Anyone with a Chase, Wells Fargo, Citi Bank account could do the world a favour by cutting that card in half. Customers of any of the fossil fuel funding banks in this list could. Phone up, tell them to cancel your account because they''re funding _still funding coal and fracking_, and put another little ding in their bottom line. Find an ethical bank, they''ve usually got better fees and more friendly support staff anyway.'
