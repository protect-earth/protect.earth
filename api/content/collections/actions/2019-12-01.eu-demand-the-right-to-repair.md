  Cracked screens, weak batteries, broken charging ports... We’d like to fix them, but instead we end up buying a new smartphone because repairs are too expensive, difficult or impossible. Reducing the lifespan of a product may drive sales, but this comes at the expense of consumers, workers and the planet. Ask the European Union to give people the Right to Repair by requiring manufacturers to design repairable smartphones and provide spare parts and repair information to all repairers and consumers.
