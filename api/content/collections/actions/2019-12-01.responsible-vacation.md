description: 'A travel company who run sustainable trips all over the world. Sail from Scotland to Iceland, cycle across Vietnam, hike in Peru. Admittedly some of these trips will require a flight to get there, but one trip a year (or alternative years) is probably reasonable. At least when you get there, these vacations will be helping and protecting local nature, wildlife and culture.'
