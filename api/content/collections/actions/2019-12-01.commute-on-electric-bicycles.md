title: 'Commute on Electric Bicycles'

description: |
  Like the idea of cycling but feel like it's a bit far, bit hilly, or no access to a shower at the other end? E-bikes aren't just for the older riders, they've pushed into the mainstream culturally and financially, and are a hell of a lot of fun. Combine it with local "cycle to work schemes" listed here for extra savings, some places do [specific deals on e-bikes](https://urbanebikes.com/pages/cycle-to-work-scheme-electric).
