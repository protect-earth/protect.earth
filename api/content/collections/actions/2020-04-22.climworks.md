description: 'Climeworks Direct Air Capture technology captures CO₂ from air, mixes the CO₂ with water used by a geothermal energy plant, then pumps it deep underground. Through natural processes, the CO₂ reacts with the basaltic rock – and turns into stone within a few years, permanently and safely. Iceland is one of several locations around the world that provide ideal conditions for our pioneering process. Subscribe monthly to offset a little bit of your footprint, and support the growth of this early stage technology.'
