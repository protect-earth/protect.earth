  Climeworks Direct Air Capture technology captures CO₂ from air, mixes the CO₂
  with water used by a geothermal energy plant, then pumps it deep underground.
  Through natural processes, the CO₂ reacts with the basaltic rock – and turns
  into stone within a few years, permanently and safely. Iceland is one of
  several locations around the world that provide ideal conditions for our
  pioneering process. Subscribe monthly to offset a little bit of your
  footprint, and support the growth of this early stage technology.
