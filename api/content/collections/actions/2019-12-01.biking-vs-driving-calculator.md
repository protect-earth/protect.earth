  Riding your bike can make you a millionaire! You're paying more for your car
  than you think. A typical American who goes car-free for 35 years can save
  nearly a million dollars, even adjusted for inflation, and even if they pay
  for taxi, bus, and car-share trips often. Use the calculator to find how much
  you can save in your particular situation.
