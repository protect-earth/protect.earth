  Hargreaves Lansdown are a big name in finance, offering savings accounts and
  pensions. They will let you invest in pretty much anything, but they've put
  together a list of "responsible investment" funds to help you defer some of
  the thinking to the finance brains. The term 'responsible investment' is often
  used as a catch-all to describe funds managed with social, environmental, or
  other responsible criteria in mind, so maybe sift through this list to find
  ones that sound good to you, whether you use HL or not.
