description: 'A great example of how a community can survive the oil apocalypse. Cubans were on the edge of starvation due to the oil crisis - the average Cuban lost 20 pounds. The Cuban people helped avert disaster from the bottom up by reclaiming land everywhere and began growing vegetables on them. Here we see the importance of recovering lost knowledge to ensure communal survival.'
