  Our bathrobes and towels are made from reforested beech wood and organic cotton, made in Portugal. Sourced from FSC-certified reforested forestry operations in Europe without irrigation. This mix needs 90% less water and emits 44% less CO2. By planting 2 trees for each towel and by compensating the carbon emissions and blue-water usage, we are a climate & resource positive textile brand, and the first certified B corporation in Germany.
