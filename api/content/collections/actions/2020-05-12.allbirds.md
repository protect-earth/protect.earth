  Our shoes are made with merino wool, tencel made from rainfall-fed FSC-certified eucalyptus forests, recycled plastic bottles (for laces), 'Sweetfoam' soles made from castor bean oil and [ProForest](https://proforest.net/en)-protected sugarcane. At 7.6 kg per pair for our wool runners, our process uses 60% less energy than materials used in typical synthetic shoes. We offset the rest, making Allbirds a carbon-neutral business.
