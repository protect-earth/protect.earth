  Open-source community who share instructions for creating plastic shredders, injectors, and sheet presses, so you can create anything you want from used plastic. Collect plastic from neighbors, clean it, shred it, [3D print a mold](https://pinshape.com/blog/low-cost-injection-molding-using-3d-printing/), and create anything you can imagine! You can [buy the machines](https://preciousplastic.com/solutions/machines/overview.html) too if making them is out of your wheelhouse.
