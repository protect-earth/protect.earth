description: |
  This circular textile award winning brand sets the new standard by clothing from local raw salvaged materials, recycling them without any chemicals, generating no wastewater, recycling their own products at end-of-life, researching and developing new ways to develop circular products.  They organize local sorting campaigns, workshops, collection campaigns, and facilitate other fashion companies in their circular transition.  Each sweater saves 500 liters of water, 60mJ of energy, uses zero chemicals, and saves at least 6kg of C02 emissions (when compared to traditional manufacturing).
