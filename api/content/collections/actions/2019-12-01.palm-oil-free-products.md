description: 'Make sure your makeup, biofuel, popcorn, candy, and other [various products](https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/palm-oil/palm-oil-free-list) are palm-oil free. The World Wildlife Fund estimates that 48 football fields worth of rainforest are cut down every minute! It’s estimated that palm oil plantations now cover around 27 million hectares. The forests being clear cut are often habitat for orangutans, who will be completely gone within 5-10 years at this rate.'
