  Air pollution is toxic. Join us in demanding change now. Simply living in the
  worst hit areas of the UK could be as deadly as smoking over 150 cigarettes
  each year. British Heart Foundation is calling for the UK Government to update
  current air quality limits to match World Health Organization recommendations.
