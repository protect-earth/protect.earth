  Vending machines and mobile refill units for refilling reusable plastic
  bottles with staple goods from shampoo to salad dressing in packaging that is
  designed to be returned, cleaned, and reused.  With over 2,000 bodegas in
  Santiago and plans to expand in the US soon, Algramo, translates to "by the
  gram", also solves the issue of "poverty tax" where small packages can cost as
  much as 50% more than the same product in a larger size.
