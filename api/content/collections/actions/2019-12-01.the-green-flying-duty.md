  The UK is one of the few countries to tax aviation fuel, but it is too low,
  and not ringfenced for climate solutions. The Green Flying Duty proposal is a
  reformed version of the UK's APD, that will be ring-fenced for Research and
  Development (R&D) in electric aviation and to improve railway connectivity.
  Suggest this to politicians worldwide.
