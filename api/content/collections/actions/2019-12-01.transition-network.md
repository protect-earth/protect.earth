  A global movement of communities coming together to reimagine and actively
  rebuild our world. The terms transition town, transition initiative and
  transition model refer to grassroot community projects that aim to increase
  self-sufficiency to reduce the potential effects of peak oil, climate
  destruction, and economic instability.
