  Economists for Future growing movement of people committed to galvanising the
  economics community behind addressing the greatest challenge of our day. If
  the discipline which dedicates itself to studying the economy cannot
  sufficiently engage in the economic transformation that the climate science
  requires, then who else can be expected to do this?
