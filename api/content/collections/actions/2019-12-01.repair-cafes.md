description: 'Repair Cafés are free meeting places and they’re all about repairing things (together). You’ll find tools and materials to help you make any repairs to clothes, furniture, electrical appliances, bicycles, crockery, appliances, toys, et cetera. You’ll also find expert volunteers, with repair skills in all kinds of fields. Repair your stuff, or just enjoy a coffee. They''re world-wide, and the site is multi-lingual.'
