description: 'Right now, while our planet speeds toward the brink of the climate crisis, Microsoft is putting its foot on the accelerator. As oil and gas profits continue to fall, giant oil corporations have turned to cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) to answer their problems. Microsoft promises companies like ExxonMobil that its analytical tools and other AI technologies will help them discover and pump even more oil at a lower cost. This Greenpeace petition will let Microsoft know this is not acceptable.'
