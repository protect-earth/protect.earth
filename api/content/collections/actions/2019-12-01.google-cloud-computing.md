description: 'Google are a long way from perfect, but Google Cloud advertises 100% renewable energy. They don''t _just_ offset, they actually reduce the electricity usage too, and "strive to build the world’s most energy-efficient computing network by squeezing more out of every watt of power we consume." Their main rival, Amazon AWS, does not do that, and actively hosts oil and gas companies, who use the platform to find more places to dig. Switching to Google Cloud (or a host who in turn is on Google Cloud), is one of many ways to make your platform have less impact on the earth.'
