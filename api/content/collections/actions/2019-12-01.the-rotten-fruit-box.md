description: '100% Natural Freeze-Dried Fruit Snacks from Spain and Portugal shipped to you. The fruit you’re enjoying would have otherwise gone unused and rotted away on the ground. We also think that the name "Rotten" helps bring attention to the serious issue of food waste. Delicious, healthy, 100% natural, with a long shelf life, our freeze dried fruit snack pouches are ideal for home, work, office, to take to school, camping or just about anywhere. Help reduce food waste. Help small local farmers. We use 100% compostable packaging and ship with your local postal service because it is the lowest carbon footprint option.  But reducing carbon emissions is not enough, and we plant trees to compensate for our CO2 emissions.'
