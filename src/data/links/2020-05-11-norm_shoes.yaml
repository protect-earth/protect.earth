  Our shoes are made from 90% recycled materials: recycled polyester (6 plastic
  bottles per pair), recycled rubber, and fairtrade rubber.  The impact for one
  pair of Norm shoes is only 6,5 kg of CO2 equivalent (80% lower than the
  industry average). We partner with a Belgian NGO, Graine de Vie, to plant two
  trees in Madagascar for each pair we sell and we offset our emissions as well.
