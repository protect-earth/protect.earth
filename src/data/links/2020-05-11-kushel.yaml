  Our bathrobes and towels are made from reforested beech wood and organic
  cotton, made in Portugal. Sourced from FSC-certified reforested forestry
  operations in Europe without irrigation. This mix needs 90% less water and
  emits 44% less CO2. By planting 2 trees for each towel and by compensating the
  carbon emissions and blue-water usage, we are a climate & resource positive
  textile brand, and the first certified B corporation in Germany.
