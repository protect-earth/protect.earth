  Our shoes are made with merino wool, tencel made from rainfall-fed
  FSC-certified eucalyptus forests, recycled plastic bottles (for laces),
  'Sweetfoam' soles made from castor bean oil and
  [ProForest](https://proforest.net/en)-protected sugarcane. At 7.6 kg per pair
  for our wool runners, our process uses 60% less energy than materials used in
  typical synthetic shoes. We offset the rest, making Allbirds a carbon-neutral
  business.
