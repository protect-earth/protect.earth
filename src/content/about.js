      Phil was <a href="https://phil.bike/trees/">raising money for trees</a> with

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">Together with contributions from 50+ people, we
      gather resources to help everyone find their next
      piece of climate action. The climate crisis might be overwhelming when you start to understand the
      severity of it all, but if we can get people on board with simplifying their lives, reducing their
      footprint, offsetting the remaining footprint for barely any money, and reducing the insane
      amounts of waste we all cause, our kids might have a chance.
