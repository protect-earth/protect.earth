intro: The best brands are ones that use ethical production and sustainable materials
---

Did you know the average American throws away 80lbs of clothing annually and that 85% of donations end up in landfill? You can help change this stat simply by altering your purchasing habits.

Integrating sustainable clothing with your life can be achieved in many different ways. An easy way to reduce your carbon footprint is to generally buy less clothing. A good approach for this is to focus your purchases on more durable clothing and fixing it instead of replacing it if it does happen to tear/wear. Another great way is to purchase second hand clothing - which keeps old clothes out of landfills while also saving you money!

If you do decide that you need to purchase new clothes, you should make sure they are coming from reputable brands that support ethical means of production. This means brands that respect both the environment as well as humans living in surrounding areas - by doing things such as avoiding the use of harmful dyes. In addition, you could make sure your clothing is produced from natural and sustainable materials like the ones listed bellow:

- Modal - a breathable material made from beech tree pulp
- Rayon/Viscose - a manufactured fibre made with wood and plant-based products
- Bamboo - the bamboo plant makes light-weight, anti-bacterial clothes
- Hemp - material made from a strain of a cannabis plant
- Wool - taken off of sheep as they grow it through eating plants
- Silk - produced by insects and woven into a beautiful material
- Linen - produced from fibres from the flax plant
- Cupro - regenerated cellulose made from cotton's waste
- Tencel - one of the most sustainable materials which is regenerated from wood cellulose
